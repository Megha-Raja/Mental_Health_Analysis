**ðŸ§  Student Mental Health Analysis**

The purpose of this project is to analyze and understand mental health trends among students based on survey data. With increasing academic pressure and lifestyle stress, it's important to identify how many students are experiencing anxiety, depression, or have a history of mental health issues. This analysis aims to bring awareness to such problems and provide insights that can help institutions take supportive action.
This project uses a dataset (StressLevelDataset.csv) that contains information on students' stress, anxiety levels, depression, and mental health history. The analysis involves loading the data, exploring important patterns, and summarizing key statistics. The goal is to provide a quick overview of mental health conditions among the surveyed students using simple visualizations and calculations.
